Raspberry Pi I2C interface demo

A brief demonstration of the Raspberry Pi I2C interface, using the SparkFun
Pi Wedge breakout board.

Resources:

This example makes use of the Wiring Pi library, which streamlines the interface
to the the I/O pins on the Raspberry Pi, providing an API that is similar to the
Arduino.  You can learn about installing Wiring Pi here:
http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/

The wiringPi SPI API is documented here:
https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/spi-library/

The init call returns a standard file descriptor.  More detailed configuration
of the interface can be performed using ioctl calls on that descriptor.
See the wiringPi SPI implementation (wiringPi/wiringPiSPI.c) for some examples.
Parameters configurable with ioctl are documented here:
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/spi/spidev

Hardware connections:

This file interfaces with the SparkFun Serial 7 Segment display:
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11629

The board was connected as follows:
(Raspberry Pi)(Serial 7 Segment)
GND  -> GND
3.3V -> Vcc
CE1  -> SS (Shift Select)
SCK  -> SCK 
MOSI -> SDI
MISO -> SDO

To build this file, I use the command:
>  g++ spitest.cpp -lwiringPi

Then to run it, first the spi kernel module needs to be loaded.  This can be 
done using the GPIO utility.
> gpio load spi
> ./a.out

This test uses the single-segment mode of the 7 segment display.  It shifts a 
bit through the display characters, lighting a single character of each at a 
time.

Development environment specifics:
Tested on Raspberry Pi V2 hardware, running Raspbian.
Building with GCC 4.6.3 (Debian 4.6.3-14+rpi1)

This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
